Doctors are resorting to this solution in order to save the lives of thousands of pregnant women who have been injured due to the lack of specialist obstetricians and necessary medical supplies. An estimated 50,000 pregnant women live in the besieged coastal enclave, with an average of 160 births expected each day for the next month. Dr. Fadel Naim, who works at Al-Ahli, the only hospital still operating in northern Gaza, describes the situation. ""It's the only option,"" he writes on his X platform account. The patient has signed a consent form acknowledging the risk of losing her fetus or the potential need for a complete hysterectomy to save her life. This our only option to save her, amidst a severe shortage of medical specialties at our hospital."

The appeal trial which opens Tuesday at the Colmar assizes will have to determine whether his murderer Jean-Marc Reiser acted with premeditation as the civil parties and the prosecution maintain, or out of a “state of fury” after an “enterprise of seduction ” which “went badly”, as he defends himself. In July 2022, the Bas-Rhin Assize Court dismissed the explanations of this cold and imposing 62-year-old man and sentenced him to life imprisonment, ruling that he had actually premeditated the murder of Sophie Le Tan, September 7, 2018. That day, the student of Vietnamese origin came to visit an apartment for rent in Schiltigheim, north of Strasbourg, spotted via an ad posted on the LeBonCoin site. Expected later to celebrate her birthday with her family, she had given no further sign of life. After his disappearance, the investigators found, despite his nicknames and multiple telephone lines, the author of the classified ad: Jean-Marc Reiser, who long denied any responsibility. The victim's body remained untraceable for more than a year, despite the involvement of her family in finding her and organized citizen searches. Until mushroom pickers stumbled upon human remains one day in October 2019, in a forest about forty kilometers from Strasbourg. Despite the overwhelming evidence, the traces of blood found in his apartment, his cellar, and even on a hacksaw, Jean-Marc Reiser continued to deny it throughout the investigation. It was only after the investigations were closed that he made a confession, disputing any desire to kill, but admitting to having entered “a phase of frustration, anger and rage” during the meeting with the student, and dealt her violent blows when she rejected his advances. It is this version that Jean-Marc Reiser wants to make the jurors hear, with the new lawyers he requested for this trial, Emmanuel Spano and Thomas Steinmetz. “There is not this pattern presented by the accusation of a man who would have planned everything for months to the millimeter, through very elaborate stratagems, to take the life, in a prepared and conscious manner, of Sophie Le Tan” , maintains Me Spano. “This version seems caricatured to us.” The lawyer emphasizes, for example, that the real estate advertisement had given rise to other meetings. Regarding Sophie Le Tan, he highlights the “disorganization” of the accused, who, although he took care to clean the scene, did not flee or take the precaution of getting rid of the saw used to dismember the body. Regarding the acts of violence, the lawyers dispute that the blows were carried out with the intention of causing death and point out that the exact cause of death could not be established. “Jean-Marc Reiser said that he did not understand how things got there, since he had already hit ex-partners without it ending that way,” points out Emmanuel Spano. Me Steinmetz recalls that the accused grew up in a family environment where violence was “trivialized”. “All the evidence is there”, believes on the contrary Me Gérard Welzer, lawyer for the Le Tan family who “would not understand that another sentence (than life imprisonment) would be imposed”. He evokes the “overwhelming charges”, Reiser’s repeated lies and his legal past: acquitted with the benefit of the doubt for the disappearance of another young woman in 2001, he was however convicted of rape in another case, in 2003. If the jurors find premeditation, the accused faces life imprisonment. This penalty is also incurred if they only consider intentional homicide, given the state of legal recidivism. But if only intentional assault and battery leading to death without intention of causing it were retained, as the defense could argue, Jean-Marc Reiser would face 30 years of imprisonment."

In the case of the ten-part series Silo, the last episode of which was broadcast by the Apple TV+ platform about two weeks ago, it is also a hit in the dark. The creators thanked not only me, but also many other viewers and critics. True, even this canapé with Rebecca Ferguson, Tim Robbins, Iain Glen and Common in the lead roles is not completely without mistakes. But after watching it, you will be pleasantly satiated. And also proper encouragement for the main course in the form of the second series, which we will see in about a year.","At the outset, I must apologize for the thematic, but modified text of the well-known ditty in the title. I simply could not help myself. However, the plot of the series deals with a huge underground shelter called, as the name suggests, the Silo. Civilization moved here after an unspecified global catastrophe. If tens of thousands of individuals still want to live and survive in harmony underground, the individual inhabitants have to follow a whole series of more or less strange rules. And as usual, some tenants of the underground shelter (and prison in one) are more inquisitive than others. And maybe more than they should. The viewer is understandably very similar after watching the first episodes. He also looks forward to getting all his nagging questions answered. That's not the only reason why Silo couldn't be missing from our online column Guardian of the Stream. Dune, Ice Ark, Lost or the game Fallout. There is no shortage of classic proprieties of a mysterious post-apocalyptic world full of all sorts of mysteries that we have already seen or heard about in some form in Silo. The Apple TV+ platform is trying for a kind of repair in the field of giant sci-fi sagas after (for many, a relatively weak Foundation). And she succeeds without fail. On an area of ​​144 floors, although in reality in a much smaller, almost oppressive space, the story of the tough mechanic Juliette (Rebecca Ferguson) starts. She comes to the role of the chief sheriff of the entire Sil as a blind man to the violin. But as the stubborn figure with the face of a charismatic Swede soon discovers, it is not at all clear who actually runs the company living in the underground bunker. That it is even a question of whether nature outside is really uninhabitable and anyone who climbs to the surface will really die soon. The creators of the series, which is based on the best-selling novel trilogy by Hugh Howey, serve the viewer a captivating and exciting story that, although it takes place underground, looks as good as possible and, above all, walks. The creation of the world, its internal intrigues and the various murders gradually draw the viewer into the story so thoroughly that it is difficult for him to wait for the publication of the next part, the creators did a great job. The series is of course best watched in one go, but who has almost sixteen hours to spare? If that's you, I highly recommend the marathon. It is also necessary to highlight the work of the screenwriters, namely the care of individual characters. Although the series attracts popular stars, you hardly see them in the first episodes. Tim Robbins and Rebecca Fergusson get space only later, the opening parts do not bet on them in any way. Exactly opposite. Silo actually goes in the opposite direction to many other series, which waste and even eliminate star characters right from the start. First, the action is kicked off by figures in the introduction, which then do not appear at all in later episodes. Also because the plot of the series takes place over several years. The only criticism I have of Sila is the otherwise much-vaunted set-piece. You can see that Apple didn't save money and the series looks epic by television standards, but I still miss a few things here. We don't have to go far for an example. The creators of the similarly tuned postapo sci-fi - Ice Ark also know well that, in order not to bore the viewer with the cramped space of the hermetically sealed train, where the action of the series takes place, they have to serve the most varied environment possible. That is why the heroes, while passing through the ark, i.e. the train, come across a garden with water flowers here, a disco, a library or a cattle breeding wagon over there. But in Silo, we don't get many similar crutches that feed our minds with something more visually friendly for a while. And that's a shame. The opening ""camera"" pass through the Force makes it clear that there is still much to see in this strange last refuge of humanity. Personally, I would like to take a look at the aforementioned and briefly seen cowshed at the beginning. And, unlike the characters in the show, I might even enjoy a visit to the iron ore mines. Maybe next time."

A similar area, although many times smaller, is also found on land. In the American southwest of Vermont lies a densely wooded area called the Bennington Triangle, where six people inexplicably disappeared between 1943 and 1950. The first of them disappeared just 80 years ago. Click to enlarge 10 photos in the gallery › The Bennington Triangle is the area of ​​southwestern Vermont where people disappeared between 1943 and 1950. | Photo: Wikimedia Commons, King of Hearts, CC BY-SA 4.0 Determining the exact boundaries of this mysterious triangle is not entirely easy, but basically it is an area defined by the towns of Bennington, Woodford, Shaftsbury, Glastenbury and Somerset, located in a densely wooded hilly area around Glastenbury Mountains. In the past, Bennington, Glastenbury and Somerset were prosperous centers of the lumber industry, but in the late 19th century, a huge flood destroyed the local sawmills, which also devastated all three towns, turning them into ghost towns. Did you know that in addition to the Bermuda Triangle, there is also the Michigan Triangle: Michigan Triangle: Ships and people disappear here. From the story of the young man who still chills to this day, the Mysterious Region has fascinated New England writer Joseph A. Citra, born in 1948, since his childhood. otherwise strange phenomena. He called this area the Bennington Triangle. However, his inspiration was not just a legend: It turned out that at least six people disappeared in the local forests between 1943 and 1950. None of them were found alive and their disappearances were never explained. ""It shook the surrounding villages, and it still boggles everyone's mind,"" said journalist Kristine De Abreu, writing about mysteries for the Explorerweb title, less than two years ago. First to die in death grip The first to go missing was 37-year-old hunter Carl Herrick, who lost his life in the woods of the Bennington Triangle 80 years ago, in November 1943. ""This incident is often overlooked in the triangle debate because Herrick's body was eventually found and the cause of death was definitively determined,"" De Abreu said. However, the case does not lose its mystery. Carl originally went into the woods with his cousin Henry to fish northeast of Glastenbury Mountain, which lies roughly in the middle of the triangle. At a distance of about 10 miles from her, they split up, but never got back together again. Carl did not appear and Henry searched for him in vain. He eventually returned from the woods without him and reported him missing to the authorities. Bennington in 1887 Source: Wikimedia Commons, Bennington, Vt., CC BY 2.0 In the following days, searchers began to search the entire area, and after several days they came across Herrick's dead body. His rifle lay next to him and was still loaded, the man had not fired it. An autopsy determined the cause of death was a grip so strong that the hunter's own ribs punctured one of his lungs. “Carl Herrick was found dead with a blackened face and scratches. His body was found near West Townshend, Vermont, where he had been hunting,"" The Cumberland Times reported ten years ago. Leopard of Rudraprayag: Ruled for eight years, killed over 120 people. He also hunted inside houses. As the most likely perpetrator, a black bear called baribal comes into consideration, whose tracks were indeed recorded near the dead body. However, for a bear attack, there were relatively few injuries on the body. However, it is not excluded that the frightened bear just beat the man, stomped on him, stepped on his chest - thereby killing him - but then only briefly examined the body and left it alone. It is worth noting that similar injuries (ribs broken by an unexplained force) also appear in several dead members of the infamous Đatlov expedition, which is one of the most famous mysteries of the 20th century. However, there is speculation that these injuries were caused by a fall, as their corpses were found in a stream bed into which they may have fallen from the overdraft. Nevertheless, thoughts about the attack of a large beast also arise in connection with woodpeckers. An experienced guide disappeared without a trace Two years later, on November 12, 1945, another man went missing in the Bennington Triangle. This time it was experienced 74-year-old hiker, hunter and mountain guide Middie Rivers. His disappearance was now a degree more mysterious. Rivers had just led a group of four hunters on a mountain trek. He knew the trail very well as he had walked it several times. At a place called Hell Hollow Brook, he decided to separate from the others for a while, promising to return by lunchtime. Then he was never seen again. He liked to take pictures with bears. One killed him and his girlfriend, the attack was caught on video Firefighters, local volunteers and finally the US Army searched for Rivers for more than a month. To no avail. The only clue they discovered was a single rifle cartridge. “Certainly, when you have an area of ​​more than nine thousand hectares, one man gets lost easily among all those stones and trees. ""If he had a heart attack and collapsed somewhere under some ferns or brush, his body may never have been found,"" noted author Cynthia Pratt on her historical mystery website. What is certain, however, is that the case of Rivers' disappearance remains unsolved. An 18-year-old student in red A year later, in 1946, an 18-year-old student at Bennington College, Paula Jean Welden, confided in her roommates that she was going to go on a shorter hike along the legendary Long Trail, which runs across Vermont. She left the dormitory at 2:45 p.m. on December 1 and hitched a ride to the trailhead with local homesteader Louis Napp, who dropped her off a few miles from the trailhead around four in the afternoon. The grizzly bear's terrible night: Deadly attacks in Montana changed the national park forever. Then, just a few minutes later, when several pedestrians following her passed through the same bend, she was gone...forever,"" Pratt recounted (according to some other sources, the girl exchanged a few words with the passing tourists, but the result was the same - as soon as she broke away from them and she was gone, no one saw her again). Eighteen-year-old Paula Jean Welden disappeared in the Bennington Triangle on December 1, 1946, while hiking the Long Trail. No trace of her was ever found Source: Wikimedia Commons, The Charley Project, free work A four-week search began, involving her father, the police, search helicopters, around a thousand men searching the terrain in the Rojnica, and also service dogs. With no result. All apparent clues led to a dead end. Paula's father eventually left Bennington and never returned. According to De Abreu, he theorized that his daughter most likely had a secret boyfriend who apparently killed her, but this was never confirmed. This case did not find a solution either. The Strangest Disappearance of All The strangest story related to the Bennington Triangle took place three years later, on the exact anniversary of Paula's disappearance. That day, a 68-year-old World War I veteran named James E. Tedford disappeared directly from a moving bus. He was driving it back to Bennington from visiting friends out of town. Somewhere between the last stop and Bennington he disappeared. However, his belongings were still in the luggage compartment, and the bus timetable lay on the next empty seat. Lost Train Mystery: Locomotive Suddenly Disappears Underground, Never Found “Fourteen passengers confirmed that he did not get off the bus before Bennington and slept the whole way. To this day, there is no explanation as to how he could have disappeared, unless all the witnesses were wrong or lying,"" says De Abreu. Writer Tony Jinks takes a slightly more sober view: ""People like to imagine that he vanished into thin air on the bus, but you have to realize that there is a time gap of about a week between when he was last seen and when he was reported missing . Although no trace of him has ever been found, we have enough evidence that he certainly did not materialize.” A boy and a woman. And the red coat again On October 12, 1950, eight-year-old Paul Jepson, who his mother, a local farmer, always took with her when she procured the farm and animals, went missing in the triangle. Also that day, she loaded him into the family van and drove him to the pigs, where she told him to wait for her in the wagon while she fed them all. When she returned to the car about an hour later, he was gone. He too was wearing a red coat before his disappearance. The police immediately searched the farm and the surrounding area and set a dog on the boy's trail. He followed her to the intersection, where he lost track. At the time she was heading towards Glastenbury Mountain, which Paul had spoken of several times in the final days before his disappearance. But despite extensive searches in that direction, the boy was never found. A mysterious phenomenon haunts a beach in Canada. Human feet wash up on it More than two weeks later, a similar fate met the 53-year-old passionate tourist Freida Langerová. The woman went on a 17km hike from Mount Glastenbury to Somerset Reservoir with her cousin Herbert Elsner and fell into a stream along the way. Because she got wet, she decided to go back to the camp and change into dry clothes. Meanwhile, Herbert waited on the trail for Freida to return. She never came back. For the next two weeks, 400 people intensively searched the area, but again without results. Only half a year later, her dead body was found 5.5 kilometers from the camp. However, due to the accelerated decomposition of the corpse, the cause of death could no longer be determined. The mystery continues Is there a connection between all these deaths? “Two of the victims were wearing red. Five victims disappeared roughly in the middle of the afternoon between 3 and 4 p.m. in places not too far from each other, and they all went missing during the last three months of the year,"" De Abreu calculated. This would suggest the actions of a serial killer, but the victims were of different genders and ages, which contradicts the usual pattern of behavior of such offenders. Horror at Lake Bodom. Unsolved teenage murders haunt Finland to this day “Uneven terrain and unpredictable weather seem to be the most likely explanations. In this area, it is very difficult to predict where the wind will blow and how strong it will be, and the temperature often changes sharply, especially in winter. It is possible that such conditions in the dense forest disorientated the tourists,"" thought De Abreu. But why were there no traces of the bodies? One possible explanation is that the tourists fell into one of the unmarked mine shafts and wells found here, another is that their corpses were dragged away and eaten by large beasts, bears and cougars. They are also mentioned as a possible ""perpetrator"", but except for the first case, it is not very likely. Cougars were nearly exterminated in New England for several decades at the time, and black bears, although they sometimes attack humans, are rarely serial killers—cannibals. The Bennington Triangle continues to keep its secret."

The proportion of women in all persons working in leading positions will be 36.3 percent in Finland in 2022. This is evident from EVA's updated Glass Ceiling Meter. In Finland, there are more women in leading positions than in OECD countries on average. However, the share of female managers in Finland has decreased in recent years. According to the EU directive, by the summer of 2026, 40 percent of the board seats of the largest listed companies must be held by an underrepresented gender, i.e. women. Finland has something to do here, as the share of women on the boards of large listed companies in Finland is 36.1 percent. ""The path to the board of directors is through the management team of a listed company and the position of CEO. Quotas are a weak band-aid for Finland's equality problems. One reason is education. In Finland, the education market is exceptionally gendered. The biggest difference is in the education of natural sciences, technical sciences and engineering, where a 40 percentage point higher proportion of men than women have received education in that field"", says Emilia Kullas, director of EVA, in the press release. EVA's Glass Ceiling Meter tracks the development of women's position in leadership, labor force participation and education in different countries. In addition, the Glass Ceiling meter is updated with the average expenses spent by households on child care and the subsidized leave granted to mothers by the government in different countries."

In a post on Facebook, he accuses the media house of having committed a ""biased, gratuitous and undocumented"" attack on the police as an institution. ""I have lost trust in DR - they have declared war on the police,"" he writes in the post: ""The last thing I want is to contribute to breaking down trust in one of society's institutions. But we find ourselves in the grotesque situation that one of these institutions, namely DR, is attacking another state institution, namely the police."" Niels Mørk's reaction comes after DR recently published the documentary 'Followed by the police?' In the documentary, you meet a Syrian family from Vejle, who have been in confrontation with the Southeast Jutland Police countless times, and it reveals a series of violent arrests, where the police use both force and pepper spray. The documentary also describes how 17-year-old Farhad Tober has allegedly been missing for a long period of time, after he was in a confrontation with officers late at night who stopped the family. Most recently there have been reports that he was supposed to be in Greece and on his way to another country. The broadcast created a great debate about the police's working methods and put the focus on four anonymized officers from the South East Jutland Police, who are involved in many of the police transactions that are dwelt on in the documentary. But according to Niels Mørk, who is joint shop steward for almost 600 officers in South-East Jutland, the documentary only shows a small section of reality. In his Facebook post, he writes that since January 2020 there have been more than 110 situations where the police and the group's members have been ""in some form of contact"". According to Niels Mørk, DR has only chosen to focus on a small sample of these situations: »DR has therefore chosen to focus on 5 percent of a number of incidents, and out of these 5 percent, they have chosen to use 5 percent of the available documentation material,' he writes and adds: 'DR has been extremely purposeful in finding and using the very few percentages, or parts per million, in an overall large complex, which can be used to criticize my colleagues.' But that is not the worst thing at all , Niels Mørk believes: ""The worst thing is that DR is basing their entire case on video recordings, which they cannot say with certainty are genuine. In any case, I have not been convinced otherwise,' he writes and adds: 'A DR journalist has told me that they have ""assessed"" that the private recordings they receive and use in their coverage have not been cut or changed in picture and/or sound. I still miss hearing from DR how they can be 100 percent sure that this is actually the case.'' ""My colleagues and their families are currently in danger of their safety due to a very, very targeted 'evidence' on the part of DR, where DR cannot even guarantee 100% that the documentation is genuine,"" writes Niels Mørk. Berlingske is working to get a comment from the editor-in-chief of DR Nyheder, Thomas Falbe. In Sunday's edition of 'Presselogen' on TV 2 News, however, he faced Niels Mørk, and here he said, among other things, that he was on target for everything in the documentary. ""All journalism is an excerpt from a reality. But it is not the case that we have excluded images that show a pleasant conversation between the family and the police or anything else that speaks the other way. Not at all,' said Thomas Falbe. He says that DR has only included footage where a court has been in and decided on the episodes that the material deals with, and where the police's charges or indictments have been dropped. ""There is also quite a lot we leave out, which can be even more violent than what we see,"" says Thomas Falbe. In his post on Niels Mørk writes, however, that he believes that the documentary contains recordings of an incident that the court has not yet ruled on.","Enter your e-mail and an optional password of min. 6 characters to create a profile.

A long press with the thumb and that was it. The decision was small but surprisingly significant when I deleted Twitter from my phone. Like I'm sure for many others, Twitter was for a long time a corner of social media where I had isolated following politics. I followed the conversation from the sidelines, a fly on the roof instead of actively participating. There are still many interesting people on Finland-Twitter, Tuomas Enbuske, who makes funny, ironic, but often positive comments about the world, should be mentioned as a single name. Twitter was a window for me to different perspectives on current topics, the best threads could even make me think about things from a completely new angle. During the last year, however, something changed, after Elon Musk bought Twitter, its atmosphere turned inwardly warm and the atmosphere became thick. My use of Twitter was problematic. I opened the app and scrolled through the chats until the steam rose from my ears. The use of social media in the 2020s is well described by the term doomscrolling, ""doomsday surfing"", i.e. constantly scrolling through the phone to get information, even if the information rush makes you feel bad. I was a textbook example myself. Cynicism and negativity are easy, as long as you salt what you spit into your mouth and throw gasoline on the flames. Even a child knows how easily an argument can get out of hand if you don't put ice in your hat. But try to say something constructive and positive, it just won't work like that. We humans have a biological ability to see threats around us."

The company is “continuously monitoring the security situation in Israel” and is “in close contact with the authorities.” Air France said it canceled its flights to Tel Aviv “until further notice”. The Polish airline LOT also said it canceled a flight to Tel Aviv on Saturday. The radical Islamic Hamas launched a new war against Israel on Saturday morning with rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip, and fighters also invaded Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip. Israel responded with retaliatory attacks. The Foreign Office is currently “strongly” advising against traveling to Israel and the Palestinian territories. Travelers who are already in Israel should keep up to date with the situation in the media and be sure to follow the instructions of local security forces, the ministry said on Saturday. The German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, urged his compatriots to stay near shelters."

She was supposed to go on at 10.30pm, but when the clock struck 11.00pm the singer behind hits like 'Summertime Sadness', Video Games' and 'Young And Beautiful' was still nowhere to be found on stage. And when she finally did show up, it was to boos from fans who weren't happy that she was late. The singer explained her delay from the stage, where she also said that she had to make her concert shorter in order not to run over time: - I'm so fucking late that I have to hurry through my set before they take the power. I'm super fucking sorry. My hair took a long time to finish. Escorted away by guards Originally the concert was to end at 11.45pm as Glastonbury is not allowed to play loud music after midnight. However, due to the delay, the singer continued his concert until 00:00. However, it didn't go any further. The power was removed and the microphone was turned off. Lana Del Rey tried to sing 'Video Games' along with the crowd. But in the end the security guards stepped in and took action and led Lana Del Rey away from her own concert. She thanked the people at the front of the audience, but in a video from the concert you can clearly hear that people are dissatisfied. Lana Del Rey last performed in Denmark in 2019, where she gave a concert at Tinderbox. Ekstra Bladet's reviewer called her 'devoid of glamor during an amateur performance' and signed off with a single star."

A few hours before the deadline, President Joe Biden signed an interim budget until November into law. This is intended to create time for new budget negotiations.","0 Published: 01. October 2023 8:42 a.m. The US Congress has just prevented the impending shutdown for the time being. A few hours before the deadline, President Joe Biden signed an interim budget until November into law. This is intended to create time for new budget negotiations. A few hours before an impending budget freeze, the US Congress passed an interim budget and thus averted a so-called shutdown. On Saturday evening, the Senate voted with 88 votes in favor and nine against for a text from the House of Representatives that ensures funding for the federal authorities until mid-November, but does not contain any additional aid to Ukraine. US President Joe Biden signed the interim budget into law. However, Biden immediately called on Congress to release new funds for Kiev in a separate law. “Under no circumstances can we allow American aid to Ukraine to be interrupted,” the president warned. The Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, must keep his commitment to “the Ukrainian people” and get new aid through the chamber of Congress. The Senate vote on Saturday evening prevented a budget freeze just three hours before the crucial deadline. If Democrats and Republicans hadn't reached an agreement at the last minute - which it looked like for a long time - the shutdown would have come into force at midnight (local time, 6 a.m. CEST). Hundreds of thousands of state employees would then have had to be sent on unpaid leave and numerous public institutions would have had to be closed. The budget dispute had been preoccupying Washington for weeks. The focus was on right-wing hardliners among the Republicans in the House of Representatives who are demanding massive spending cuts - and are also opposing the new $24 billion (22.7 billion euros) in aid to Ukraine called for by Biden. The opposition Republicans make up the majority in the House of Representatives, while the Senate is controlled by Biden's Democrats. I just signed a law to keep the government open for 47 days. There’s plenty of time to pass Government funding bills for the next fiscal year, and I strongly urge Congress to get to work right away. The American people expect their government to work. Let’s make sure it does. pic.twitter.com/ffjwUIPWIt During the week, Republican and Democratic senators initially presented a compromise proposal for an interim budget, but it was rejected by McCarthy. The text would have included around six billion dollars in new aid to Ukraine. A proposal for an interim budget presented by McCarthy failed in the House of Representatives on Friday due to resistance from ultra-right hardliners - and the signs pointed to a shutdown. But in a dramatic twist on Saturday, McCarthy presented a new proposal for an interim budget that would ensure funding for federal agencies for 45 days, thereby creating time for new budget negotiations. There were turbulent scenes in Congress: While the Democrats were examining the text, one of their representatives, Jamaal Bowman, set off a fire alarm in a congressional building. Bowman's office said it was an accident. However, the Republicans accused the representative of trying to delay the process. The text ultimately passed the House of Representatives with a clear majority, with more Democrats voting for McCarthy's text than Republicans. The Democrats were bitter about the cancellation of new aid to Ukraine, but wanted to avoid a budget freeze at all costs. The text was then adopted by the Senate at around 9 p.m. (local time). McCarthy's position is also at stake in the dispute: the right-wing wing of his group had threatened to remove him if the draft was approved with the support of the Democrats. “You know what, if I have to risk my post to defend the American people, I will,” McCarthy said Saturday. Right-wing hardliner Lauren Boebert declined to comment afterwards on whether the group would try to remove McCarthy from office. In the USA there have been repeated budget freezes in recent decades. The last one occurred in December 2018 and January 2019 under then-President Donald Trump - and at 35 days was the longest in US history.

The article was written before the attack of the Hamas organization on Israel on October 7, 2023 and the subsequent Israeli retaliatory attacks on the Gaza Strip.) Palestinian Saadeh Ersheid remembers like it was yesterday, how in the fall of 1993 the Oslo peace agreement signed between the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was celebrated at the Jenin refugee camp. People took to the streets to sing and show signs of victory. Pictures were shown on TV showing PLO leader Yasser Arafat shaking hands with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Washington. In the middle of them stood the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, with his arms outstretched on either side of the former sparring partners. The PLO had promised to recognize the state of Israel, and Israel in turn promised to recognize the Palestinians' right to initially limited self-government. Behind was the Palestinian uprising that lasted six years, in which two thousand Palestinian youths had died from the bullets of Israeli soldiers. But now the years of trials were over and the Palestinians could start building their own self-government in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. In the celebration, the youth of the refugee camp climbed on top of Israeli military vehicles and handed the soldiers olive branches, the now 68-year-old Saadeh Ersheid recalls in an article published by Al Jazeera. The Israeli soldiers were amused and mocked the Palestinian youth. The following year, Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The Oslo agreement of 30 years ago did not bring peace to Palestine, nor did it bring real self-government. Today, the Jenin refugee camp, located in the northern part of the West Bank, is a miserable slum of apartment buildings for twenty thousand people, where unemployment is rampant and public services are conspicuous by their absence. The area is called a refugee camp because the residents are descendants of Palestinian families who were expelled from their homes during Israel's independence. Jenin belongs to the small part of the West Bank that officially belongs to the Palestinian Authority. Despite this, Israeli forces have attacked Jenin several times this year using drones, helicopters and sending at most 2,000 soldiers to the area. Dozens of people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Jenin, and thousands more have fled the violence to other parts of the Palestinian Territory. Elsewhere in the occupied territories, at least 200 people have been killed in Israeli attacks this year. According to the human rights organization B'Tselem, Israeli soldiers have killed more than 10,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories since 2000. The Oslo agreement was supposed to lead to permanent peace in Palestine and Israel within five years, but ""the result was an even more violent occupation of Israel and an even more deeply rooted apartheid system"", as the Palestinian researcher Marwin Bishara expresses it. In Bishara's opinion, the negotiation process was very one-sided. In the negotiations led by US and Norwegian diplomats, Israel was largely allowed to dictate the terms. Thus, Israel remained in possession of almost 80 percent of the territory of historical Palestine, and the Palestinians were promised that they would be allowed to administer about one fifth of the territory in the future. At Israel's insistence, the negotiations did not address many issues central to the future of Palestine at all, such as the status of illegal settlements built in the occupied territories, the situation of Palestinian refugees driven from the territory of Israel, and the future of Jerusalem. Today, the idea of ​​an independent Palestinian state seems very distant on the ground. More than 200 Jewish settlements have been built in the occupied West Bank, where almost a million people live. More residents are constantly being attracted to the settlements with tax breaks, jobs and subsidies. The settlements cover 42 percent of the area of ​​the West Bank. Only 18 percent of the West Bank area is under the control of the Palestinian Authority. A protective wall over 700 kilometers long has also been built in the Palestinian territory. Contrary to what you might imagine, only a small part of the wall runs along the border between Israel and the West Bank. For the most part, the wall snakes deep into the occupied West Bank, separating Jewish settlements and Israeli-only highways from areas permitted for the Palestinian population. In many places, the wall has been erected arbitrarily in the middle of Palestinian residential areas, and Palestinians have been denied access to the farmlands located behind the wall. According to Israeli law, land left uncultivated can be expropriated. Israel's deepening colonial rule is maintained by the local administration and security forces of the Palestinian territories. In the West Bank, the administration of President Mahmoud Abbas is accused of authoritarianism and of acting as a cashier of the Israeli occupation. The 87-year-old Abbas has been president since 2005 without an election. When there is no functioning parliament, Abbas decides on the affairs of the region with the decrees he draws up alone. Last year, he appointed himself head of the Supreme Council of Courts, which he had just established. The oppressive apparatus is maintained by the Palestinian Authority's hard-line security forces, whose salaries and operating expenses spend more money than education and health services combined."

According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, it will soon be possible to use two different WhatsApp accounts on the same phone. You can switch between them quickly. The message did not mention an exact schedule or whether the function will come to both Android and iOS at the same time. WhatsApp has previously allowed you to use the same account on several different devices. So now it's about using two different accounts on the same phone. This is useful if the phone has a place for two SIM cards and the user has two different mobile connections, for example for home and work. Rival Telegram has long allowed a maximum of three accounts to be used on the same device. Zuckerberg spoke separately about another change, which concerns channels already seen on WhatsApp. They will also come to Messenger and Facebook in the next few weeks.

The calls for more transparency are getting louder.,"A heated argument has broken out in the Turkish art scene over the selection of the curator for next year. The Istanbul Foundation for Culture and Art (IKSV), which has been organizing the art event for 35 years, named British art historian Iwona Blazwick as curator for the 18th edition. Istanbul Biennale in September 2024. “We are delighted that Iwona Blazwick has accepted our invitation to host the 18th. “To curate the Istanbul Biennale,” said IKSV director Görgün Taner. Blazwick himself was a member of the advisory board. The Turkish cultural scene was blown away as the advisory board appointed by the IKSV had suggested the Turkish curator Defne Ayas, who works in Berlin, for the Biennale. The IKSV's decision is controversial, not least because it was made six months ago but was only announced now - and because Blazwick himself was a member of the advisory board that recommended Ayas for the position. The advisory board's recommendation was unanimous As the Turkish art critic Kaya Genc reconstructed in a chronicle of events, in December 2022 the IKSV appointed five experts to the advisory board to select the curators for 2024; In addition to Blazwick, these were the curators Agustin Perez Rubio, Yuko Hasegawa and Selen Ansen as well as the Armenian-Turkish artist Sarkis. The advisory board unanimously recommended Defne Ayas for the post in January 2023 and was informed shortly afterwards by the IKSV that the foundation would not follow this recommendation and would make another choice. In protest against this decision, Rubio and shortly afterwards Ansen and Sarkis resigned from the advisory board, but without making any public statement. The IKSV dissolved the advisory board and designated Blazwick as curator, but only now publicly announced this decision. International curator was desired “As all members of the advisory board know, the final decision always lies with the IKSV board,” emphasized the foundation in a written statement. After carefully evaluating the advisory board's suggestions, the board decided on Blazwick, who is ""known for her experience and success in the international art world."" When asked by art critic Kaya, IKSV director Taner added that the board expressly wanted an “international curator” for the 2024 Biennale – apparently not a Turkish one. The decision was met with outrage in the Turkish art scene. Kaya Genc criticized the fact that Blazwick, as a member of the advisory board, did not stand behind her rejected recommendation for Ayas, but instead had herself nominated for the office, was “disturbing and unethical.” Demand for transparency A spontaneously founded artist initiative around the video artist Köken Ergün and the curator Merve Elveren demanded from the IKSV “transparency in the selection process, openness to criticism and answers to questions about transparency and accountability,” as Genc, ​​as a member of the initiative, said the magazine “ArtReview” reported. In response to all inquiries, Defne Ayas simply said that she hoped the controversy would lead to more transparency in the selection process and a better dialogue with the art scene. One can only speculate about the reasons for the IKSV decision, said Kaya, recalling a collaboration between Ayas and Sarkis at the , where the Armenian genocide was also discussed. However, the fact that Sarkis herself was appointed to the advisory board by the IKSV speaks against the assumption that the IKSV rejected the curator for this reason. The IKSV is a private, non-profit foundation that is supported by wealthy patrons such as the Eczacibasi family and their pharmaceutical group; According to research by cultural scientist Osman Erdem, only four percent of their budget comes from public money. Of course, one could criticize the Istanbul Biennale for some sponsors and cases of censorship, Erdem wrote in the magazine “PoliticalYol”. Overall, the exhibition has so far resisted all attacks on art. “In Turkey, where even a kiss in the subway has become a political issue, the Istanbul Biennale still provides breathing room,” Erdem wrote. The IKSV must defend this value that it has created over a long time. The dispute is now overshadowing the dispute, which is also organized by the IKSV and should be led by the curator Esra Sarigenedik Öktem. Öktem has now resigned from her position and expressly denied to the independent news portal T24 that this had happened in protest against the decision in favor of Balzwick at the Istanbul Biennale; Rather, she wanted to avoid a conflict of interest after the artist Gülsün Karamustafa, represented by her art company, was selected for an installation in the pavilion. Dismay over the selection process However, the events surrounding Defne Ayas “deeply dismayed her and also illuminated the need for a more transparent selection process and the lack of mutual exchange,” she added in her resignation statement."

Palestinian militants entered Israel by land, sea and air. The country was officially put on war alert. Palestinian militants fired 2,200 rockets from the Gaza Strip at targets in Israel this morning, according to the army. Warning sirens wailed in various cities across the country. Rocket alarms were also heard in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The military called on residents of the southern and central parts of the country to move to protected areas. In addition, according to the army, armed Palestinians were advancing into Israel. There was heavy fighting with Israeli soldiers. At least 40 people were killed, according to the Israeli emergency service, and at least 779 were injured, according to the Health Ministry. The authorities expect more victims. The Israeli military responded by shelling targets in the Gaza Strip. A spokesman said dozens of fighter jets were involved in the attack. 17 military installations and four command centers of the Islamist Hamas, which rules in the Gaza Strip, were attacked. liveblog October 7th, 2023 Attack on Israel ++ UN Secretary General condemns Hamas ""in the strongest possible terms"" ++ All developments on the state of war in Israel in the live blog. more Palestinians invade Israel The militant Palestinians entered Israel by land, sea and air, said army spokesman Richard Hecht. There are currently fighting with Israeli soldiers in various locations around the Gaza Strip. These included two military bases, the Eres crossing into the Gaza Strip and several towns. Israeli television showed armed terrorists from Gaza invading Israeli towns such as the 30,000-inhabitant city of Sderot. It is two kilometers from the border. A video shows fighters standing on a balcony. Terrorists ring doorbells, people lie shot dead on the ground at a bus stop. A woman reports in fear as she waits for help in the bunker with her husband and child. Gal Naim, a resident of Sderot, sent this message to ARD from his home: Our worst fears have come true. Terrorists who want to kill us walk our streets. It is reminiscent of the ISIS terrorists who drove their jeeps through the desert in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are at my door. We are under siege in our homes with our loved ones. We hear gunshots and explosions echoing through the streets. We are stressed, but we are Zionists and we are not afraid. Images received by ARD employees from Gaza show live captured soldiers under a tarpaulin, terrorists driving around in an Israeli military jeep and a crowd trampling on a dead soldier. Hamas were able to cross barriers How the militants were able to advance into Israel despite strict border controls is unclear. Army spokesman Hecht said that, among other things, gliders were used. He could not name the number of attackers. Israel has built a massive fence along the border with Gaza to prevent infiltration. It also runs deep underground and is equipped with cameras, high-tech sensors and sensitive listening technology. The fact that Hamas has overcome the barriers is a great success for it. { ""@context"" : ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"" : ""NewsArticle"", ""potentialAction"" : { ""@type"" : ""SeekToAction"", ""target"" : ""https://www. tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video-1257574.html?t={seek_to_second_number}"", ""startOffset-input"" : ""required name=seek_to_second_number"" }, ""dateModified"" : ""2023-10-07T15:48:34.446+ 02:00"", ""datePublished"" : ""2023-10-07T15:36:47.861+02:00"", ""headline"" : ""Chaotic conditions in Israel after Hamas attack"", ""description"" : ""Chaotic conditions in Israel after Attack by Hamas"", ""keywords"" : [ ], ""mainEntityOfPage"" : ""https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video-1257574.html"", ""author"" : { ""@type"" : ""Person "", ""name"" : ""Christian Limpert, BR"" }, ""publisher"" : { ""@type"" : ""Organization"", ""name"" : ""tagesschau.de"", ""logo"" : { ""@type"" : ""ImageObject "", ""url"" : ""https://www.tagesschau.de/resources/assets/image/json_logo_amp.png"", ""width"" : 340, ""height"" : 60 } }, ""image"" : [ { ""@ type"" : ""ImageObject"", ""url"" : ""https://images.tagesschau.de/image/4410fb13-7b67-4c1a-9bcc-16f5a6447519/AAABiwpZFLE/AAABibBxrfI/16x9-1920/versandsbild-1219940.jpg"", "" author"" : ""ARD-aktuell"", ""width"" : 1920, ""height"" : 1080, ""datePublished"" : ""2023-10-07T15:36:47.861+02:00"", ""description"" : ""Broadcast image"", "" name"" : ""Show image"" }, { ""@type"" : ""ImageObject"", ""url"" : ""https://images.tagesschau.de/image/4410fb13-7b67-4c1a-9bcc-16f5a6447519/AAABiwpZFLE/AAABibBx1ms/1x1 -840/versandsbild-1219940.jpg"", ""author"" : ""ARD-aktuell"", ""width"" : 840, ""height"" : 840, ""datePublished"" : ""2023-10-07T15:36:47.861+02:00 "", ""description"" : ""Show image"", ""name"" : ""Show image"" } ], ""thumbnail"" : [ { ""@type"" : ""ImageObject"", ""url"" : ""https://images.tagesschau.de/ "" datePublished"" : ""2023-10-07T15:36:47.861+02:00"", ""description"" : ""Shipment image"", ""name"" : ""Shipment image"" }, { ""@type"" : ""ImageObject"", ""url"" : ""https://images.tagesschau.de/image/4410fb13-7b67-4c1a-9bcc-16f5a6447519/AAABiwpZFLE/AAABibBx1ms/1x1-840/versandsbild-1219940.jpg"", ""author"" : ""ARD-aktuell"", ""width "" : 840, ""height"" : 840, ""datePublished"" : ""2023-10-07T15:36:47.861+02:00"", ""description"" : ""Shipment image"", ""name"" : ""Shipment image"" } ], ""name "" : ""Chaotic conditions in Israel after Hamas attack"", ""thumbnailUrl"" : [ ""https://images.tagesschau.de/image/4410fb13-7b67-4c1a-9bcc-16f5a6447519/AAABiwpZFLE/AAABibBxrfI/16x9-1920/versandsbild -1219940.jpg"", ""https://images.tagesschau.de/image/4410fb13-7b67-4c1a-9bcc-16f5a6447519/AAABiwpZFLE/AAABibBx1ms/1x1-840/versandsbild-1219940.jpg"" ], ""uploadDate"" : "" 2023-10-07T15:48:34.446+02:00"", ""embedUrl"" : ""https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video-1257574~player.html"", ""contentUrl"" : ""https: //media.tagesschau.de/video/2023/1007/TV-20231007-1530-1600.webxxl.h264.mp4"", ""duration"" : ""PT1M31S"", ""expires"" : ""2025-10-06T00:00: 00.000+02:00"" } Chaotic conditions in Israel after Hamas attack Christian Limpert, BR, tagesschau, October 7th, 2023 3:28 p.m. ""We are at war"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video message from the military headquarters in Tel Aviv: "" Citizens of Israel, we are at war.""

We announce the start of Operation Al Aqsa Flood."" He spoke of 5,000 rockets fired.

Four Palestinians have been killed there since Thursday in their own attacks or in confrontations with the Israeli army. There have been several violent protests at the Gaza border in the past month. Explosive devices were also thrown at soldiers and several Palestinians were injured by gunfire. The Israeli Air Force repeatedly attacked Hamas posts in the Gaza Strip in response to the incidents. According to the UN, more than two million people live in very poor conditions in the Gaza Strip. Hamas, classified as a terrorist organization by the EU, USA and Israel, violently seized sole power in 2007. Israel then tightened a blockade of the coastal area, which Egypt supported.

115f439badbba1bea9e72d4b0071be5d,https://magyarnemzet.hu/ahelyzet/2023/10/oexc-david-szamlazik,hungary,His Excellency David is billing,"Due to his behavior that goes beyond all limits, Pressman is already being driven away like a cow to the fair by the chancellery minister.","""Mr. Attorney Pressman?"" This is Ellen Pinchuk talking - the pretty, middle-aged woman hummed into the phone, but this still left the called party cold. - Mihail Dimitrijevic is very satisfied, we transferred the five thousand dollars. You know, it's not always easy to prevail in Putin's world, but you know the Dakota saying: Scratch, kurta, you'll get it too! laughed Mihail Prokhorov, his American companion, and then dialed David Pressman on his phone without waiting for an answer. The parachutist from New York did not seem like an exciting figure. A low-level provocateur who throws his guts out in the dead of twenty-four for a paltry two million a year. Mihail Dimitrijevics has 11 billion in his assets. Could it have happened that way? According to the current situation, that is the case. Recommender David Pressman helped a Russian oligarch evade sanctions David Pressman helped a Russian oligarch close to Vladimir Putin evade economic sanctions as a lawyer before he came to our country as an ambassador. While a Californian Ellen Pinchuk was straightening out the American affairs of that Prokhorov, who as an oligarch and as a fusillade presidential candidate reconciled with the Putin regime, he received the Order of Merit for Friendship from Vladimir Vladimirovich, the master of all Russians, and even before Pressman brought himself under the scope of the American sanctions law and his Pinchuk would have established the account book relationship. Recommendation David Pressman's protégé is tied to Putin by a thousand threads The Russian oligarch, patronized by the American ambassador, actively helped the Russian president in his political life. This time, the American ambassador did not write anything on social media about what he was doing. It wouldn't be so interesting if Pressmanen hadn't mastered this week, too, not to mention ""Hungary begs for business"" after seeing the joint photo of Viktor Orbán and Vladimir Putin. Or so! If - as last time in 2021, many years after the Russian occupation of Crimea, which is considered a watershed in the West - President Joe Biden, Pressman's client, shakes hands with Putin, world politics, if the United States buys uranium from Russia on an unprecedented scale, it is in the national interest, but if ( as they see us) the head of the NATO province of Hunnia sits down with one of the main world political actors, then he ""begs for business"". Recommended Who imagines himself as a governor in the colonies - Pressman's rampage has been going on for a year + video The ambassador forgets again and again that he was not asked by the United States to be a political activist when he was sent to our country. This is how the world looks His Excellency. According to the Budapest ambassadors, when David saw the photo, he must have given up, who immediately put their heads together to see if Putin had promised Orbán two villages in addition to Beregszász. We understand the joke, even if we don't - we just don't like it. Due to his behavior that goes beyond all limits, Pressman is already driven away like a cow at the fair by the chancellor - while the prime minister, whom he has been trying to get in for thirteen months, does not accept him. We live in the age of mints. As if Hungary did not condemn Russia's aggression in Ukraine in the same way (whatever else we think about Ukraine). As if we don't want peace. As if Pressman were a diplomat, and not a provocateur dressed as a diplomat, who has been interfering in Hungarian public affairs step by step for a year - sometimes choosing a sexual minority march and sometimes an X (Twitter) message as the right media opportunity. His repertoire is wide. It's as if a virtigli scumbag sent it to us, Hungarians, who, according to him, are ""begging for business"", from a country where interest on interest sounds more sensual than the Nadír romance by Bizet in Europe, where no one takes two lines from anyone. can recite by heart, unlike the palladium price from the daily stock market. And it's like we won't get out until the beginning of 2025, until he finally pulls back to his Pinchuks like a wild goose over Brooklyn. Recommended by István Hollik: David Pressman's statements are two-faced, discredited and false + video The Fidesz communications director also spoke about the American ambassador's statements, Hungary's terror preparedness and Hungarian-Chinese relations."

He wants her to be ""powerful and independent""","The ruler of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary. He assured that he was a big supporter of the European Union.","The meeting of Alexander Lukashenko and Minister of Foreign Affairs Petr Szijjarto took place in Minsk during the international conference on Eurasian security. To the surprise of journalists present at the event, Lukashenko uttered several warm words towards the European Union. Lukashenko: I am a strong supporter of the survival of the EU - For some reason, the European Union believes that Belarus is its opponent. We are not vindictive people and despite the current turmoil in the EU and the sanctions introduced against us, you should know that I am a passionate supporter of the survival of the European Union, said the Belarusian president. The politician emphasized that it was not about the fact that he loved the European Union. He explained that in his opinion it is - together with the USA, China, Russia and, to some extent, India - ""a strong support for the existence of our planet."" – If this pillar is torn out from under the system, it will be very bad for everyone – he explained. Additionally, Lukashenko added that he wanted the EU to be ""powerful, strong, sovereign and independent."" – This is our goal. And you should know this, given all the nuances in the relations and policy that the EU is currently pursuing towards Belarus. We are supporters of the Union, he assured. EU sanctions on Belarus Since August 2020, when Alexander Lukashenko declared himself president after rigged elections and brutally suppressed protests, the European Union has gradually expanded sanctions against specific citizens of Belarus, as well as Belarusian companies and institutions. In total, the EU imposed five packages of sanctions on Belarus. When Belarus supported Russia in its invasion of Ukraine last year, the sanctions were expanded to include further economic and trade restrictions. A total of 195 people, including Aleksandr Lukashenko and the regime leader's closest entourage, are banned from entering the territory of the European Union and their assets in Europe are blocked. In addition, 34 Belarusian companies and institutions have their assets blocked in the EU."

Above all, it should send the signal that the government and opposition are working together to address the massive migration problem. But what exactly will follow from this is anyone's guess.","The meeting took place “in a good and constructive atmosphere for discussion,” it was said from Union circles late on Friday evening. A photo also bears witness to this: you can see the Chancellor (SPD) together with the opposition leader (CDU) and the Prime Ministers Boris Rhein (CDU) and (SPD) in the dark on the balcony of the Chancellery. “A hint of a grand coalition,” said one person afterwards. However, this is not in sight even after the migration summit, or otherwise, whether there will be close cooperation between the government and the opposition remains unclear. Although you want to continue the two and a half hour conversation. Rather, Merz surprised the Chancellor with a comprehensive catalog of measures to limit migration - 16 demands to be implemented, ten to the European level. Because Rhein and Weil were late after the Prime Minister's Conference, Scholz and Merz had the opportunity for a longer one-on-one conversation. Which happens rarely enough, and which Merz complains about from time to time. We know that they both appreciate each other, but don't get along particularly well. Merz then said on ZDF that he had the impression “that the Chancellor now really wants to talk seriously about limiting immigration to Germany.” The CDU leader added: “And we agree on the goal. The next few days and weeks will show whether we agree on the path.” At least we have already come closer. The two Prime Ministers Rhein and Weil, chairmen of the MPK, also said that there had been a good exchange in the Chancellery. “There is clearly a willingness to agree on a sensible common migration policy,” emphasized Weil. “Citizens should now be able to have the justified feeling very quickly that the democratic parties are doing the right thing and that they are doing it together without arguing.” The background to the discussions is the sharp increase in the number of refugees in Germany. The federal states expect that significantly more than 300,000 people will come to Germany this year - not counting refugees from Ukraine. How both sides want to proceed now remains to be seen. Scholz, who also praised the meeting, said things that the Union had previously emphasized, it was said from the Merz camp. The Chancellor also “demonstratively sought proximity” to the opposition - some people then commented that this was also due to the state of his traffic light coalition, and the relationship with the Greens in particular was strained. But Scholz cannot simply take up the demands made by the Union. A coalition is just a coalition. It was mainly the signal that mattered, it was said after the conversation. The Union paper, which is available to our editorial team, says: “Germany’s reception capacities are exhausted.” There is a need for a “common understanding that Germany can tolerate asylum immigration of up to a maximum of 200,000 people per year with a view to the integration infrastructure and social cohesion .” The upper limit, there it is again. The word “limitation” must also be included again in the traffic light government’s residence law. In addition, the Union is calling for the expansion of safe countries of origin, stationary border controls with Poland, the Czech Republic and Switzerland and the stopping of voluntary federal admission programs. Something similar can already be found in an application to the Bundestag. The opposition also advocates the establishment of transit zones and return centers. In transit zones, an accelerated procedure must be carried out at the national borders for asylum seekers with little prospect of staying. “Rejected asylum seekers should then be accommodated in return centers based on the Danish model,” the paper says. Hurdles to repatriation would also have to be removed. In addition, they want to create a social benefit level for rejected asylum seekers and people in the asylum procedure below the level of citizen's benefit. An extension of the waiting period for equality with those insured by statutory health insurance to at least 36 months is also necessary. In the three-page paper, the opposition also calls for the most modern border protection technology for the . “In particular night vision and thermal imaging cameras, drones, heartbeat sensors for checking trucks.” The Union emphasized that there are a number of “national and European measures that would initiate a real change in migration policy.” Nevertheless, the paper is said to have played a subordinate role in the conversation; It was therefore more about the decisions of the Prime Minister's Conference. However, the Union Parliamentary Secretary (CDU) told our editorial team: “The Union put concrete proposals on the table on Friday evening. Now it’s up to the Chancellor to accept our offer.” Frei added that it was good that Scholz was trying to correct course. “However, what is needed is no further announcements for St. Nicholas Day, but rather concrete steps to limit and significantly reduce illegal migration to Germany and Europe.” Those who are currently particularly suffering from the influx of refugees, the cities and municipalities, assessed In any case, the conversation was a success: the vice president of the city council, Burkhard Jung, told our editorial team that there had been no concrete decisions. “Nevertheless, the meeting was the important signal that has been needed for a long time that the months-long calls for help from the cities have reached federal politics and that there is a willingness to look for tangible solutions together.” The mayor of Leipzig added: “The federal and state governments as well as the government and the opposition are allowed to do so After the talks, don’t fall back into old patterns and pass the buck to each other.” We’ll see."

But the whales' lives could not be saved. The 45 stranded whales on a beach in Western Australia had to be euthanized, the New York Times reports. - It was extremely difficult, but it was a considerate and well-thought-out decision. It was on Tuesday that the large herd of pilot whales was seen for the first time at Cheynes Beach near Albany in Australia. Drone images show how the whales swim very closely together in different formations for several hours. Local authorities feared that a mass stranding was on the way. - Healthy pilot whales generally do not behave like this, and when you see it, you understand that there is something strange going on, says Kate Sprogis, a marine ecologist at the University of Western Australia to the New York Times. The concern turned out to be justified. In the afternoon, the whales had swum too close to shore and beached themselves. Major rescue effort Videos published on social media show how the approximately 100 whales were lying on their sides and backs and splashing in the shallow water. A major rescue operation was launched to save them. The next day, local authorities were able to confirm that 51 of them had died. The remaining 45 initially appeared to be salvageable – all able to be brought back to deeper water with the help of boats and kayaks guiding them out. But soon the herd had been stranded again further away on the beach. Then the decision was made to euthanize them. ""A thoughtful decision"" Peter Hartley from the regional wildlife authority describes it as ""the most difficult decision of my 34-year career"". - It was extremely difficult, but it was a considerate and well-thought-out decision, Hartley said at a press conference on Thursday, according to CNN. Shoals of whales swimming ashore is a phenomenon that occurs at regular intervals - but scientists are unsure why. Scientist's theories: Why whales strand Kate Sprogis tells the New York Times that one theory is it happens when the leader of the pack, who is a matriarch, gets sick and swims towards shallow water. Then the rest of the herd can follow because they are social animals with strong bonds to each other, Sprogis explains. Another theory is that they are disoriented by loud noises below the surface of the water, as the animals locate themselves using sound waves. According to Peter Hartley at the wildlife conservation agency, the whales must now be analyzed to find answers as to why they stranded. See also:"

View Article L’article Bomb threats at the start of school: holidays end differently in Russia and Ukraine is published in the premier on Tageblatt.lu.","Schoolchildren in Irpin sang the national anthem at the start of school yesterday. At the beginning of the war, Russian soldiers committed the most serious war crimes in the city in northwestern Kiev. While Vladimir Putin jokes with students at the end of the holiday in Russia, the start of school in Kiev is paralyzed by bomb threats. Meanwhile, the USA certified that Ukraine had made “remarkable” progress in its offensive in the south of the country.

The Ukrainian armed forces suffered “significant” losses. Ukraine recaptured Kupyansk and surrounding areas last year. However, Russian troops are trying to regain control of the areas. Russia: “Difficult” fighting Ukraine launched a counteroffensive against Russian positions in the south in June. Russia then attempted to recapture areas in the northeast. The Russian Defense Ministry described the fighting in the east and south of Ukraine as “difficult” on Friday. The USA, Kiev's biggest supporter, meanwhile certified that Ukraine had made “remarkable progress” against Russian troops in the south of the country. Responding to criticism that Kiev's fight against Moscow's troops in the south had made little progress in the past three months, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the fight had been slower than Ukraine itself had hoped. “Nevertheless, in the past 72 hours or so, we have seen some notable progress by Ukrainian forces on the southern front line.” Meanwhile, Ukraine announced for the first time that it was operating from Russian territory. A drone attack on Pskov airport in Russia, in which several military aircraft were hit, was launched from Russian territory, Ukrainian intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said online. He shared a link to an article in the online portal specializing in defense issues. In the article about the attack on Pskov, the intelligence chief is quoted as saying: “We work from Russian territory.” The Kremlin did not want to comment on the information. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, warned that there could be no “sustainable peace in Ukraine or even in Europe” until Russia withdraws from Crimea, Donbass and other occupied territories. “Crimea, a peninsula that once attracted tourists and businesses, is now an occupied and militarized territory that cannot develop,” he said in a video conference. “Look at what happened in Crimea. Did the occupation bring civilization, tourism, trade? None of this.” “Ukraine and other countries that respect international law” would not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and neither would “the companies,” Zelensky said. He called on Russia to withdraw its troops. Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014 in violation of international law. (AFP) After Moscow canceled the grain agreement, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that “negotiations” were taking place in the Black Sea town of Sochi. Turkey is pushing for Russia and Ukraine to revive the agreement that allowed Ukrainian grain to be exported across the Black Sea. The agreement was reached through mediation by Turkey and the UN and was terminated by Moscow in July. (AFP)"

But little has changed in Frankfurt (Oder) so far.,"The federal police are gradually enforcing the stationary controls at the Polish border that Federal Interior Minister Faeser had notified to the EU. But little has changed in Frankfurt (Oder) so far. The federal police have been implementing the new border controls on the German-Polish border since Monday evening. In an initial assessment, the federal police found around 45 people entering the country without permission in Frankfurt (Oder) and in towns in southern Brandenburg. In addition, the traffic disruptions caused by the controls were manageable, it was said. There have been no backlogs at the border so far, federal police spokesman Jens Schobranski told rbb. The aim of setting up fixed controls is to reduce smuggling crime at the border. In general, it can be assumed from now on that the focus will now be on fixed controls at all border crossings, emphasized Schobranski. For a long time, Federal Interior Minister Faeser rejected stationary border controls, although they were repeatedly called for. Now she wants to register them with the EU. This should also make controls on the border with Poland more intensive. At first glance, little has changed at the Frankfurt city bridge compared to the previous procedure. The first federal police officers stand on the bridge, look at the vehicles passing through and give their colleagues a few meters further in Frankfurt - posted on a traffic island - relevant information via radio about which vehicles and people should be checked. It is important that border traffic should be disrupted as little as possible. ""If you walk across the city bridge, you won't notice any change at best. Not everyone is checked - only random samples should be taken,"" explained Schobranski. Sometimes, like at the Frankfurt city bridge, checks are carried out stationarily at former border crossings, and sometimes only temporarily. Schobranski didn't want to say more about it for tactical reasons. But you have to be prepared for controls everywhere on the German-Polish border. The focus is on international transport axes."" One such axis is the A12 motorway. There is currently no checkpoint when entering Brandenburg, said Schobranski. Police patrols are on hand to pull out suspicious vehicles between the border bridge and the Frankfurt-Mitte junction. However, a checkpoint should be built near the border bridge on the German side. According to Schobranski, the speed of travel will soon be reduced to two lanes. “Then we randomly wave you out into the hard shoulder and check. Ahead of the Polish parliamentary election on Sunday, German-Polish relations are a campaign issue. The focus is on the illegal entry of refugees - and the accusation that Poland is simply waving them on to Germany. According to the Federal Police, random checks were carried out in Guben on Tuesday morning. Smaller crossings like this are not constantly monitored. This is different on the A15. But fixed controls are only a first step, said Guben Mayor Fred Mahro (CDU). ""We have to ensure that we in the EU secure the external borders."" For him, it is just as important that people in the countries of origin are explained that there is no prospect of staying in Germany and Europe, so that they do not set off in the first place. There was also encouragement from Märkisch-Oderland. “First of all, I think it’s right that we introduce controls at the border. In the end, the districts, cities and municipalities in Brandenburg are the ones who have to bear the burden of disorderly immigration,"" emphasized District Administrator Gernot Schmidt (SPD). The police union (GdP) continues to view the measure critically. The GdP chairman for the federal police, Andreas Roßkopf, said on Tuesday on rbb24 Inforadio that he hoped that the fixed controls would not become a permanent situation. He called it ineffective to tie forces in one place 24 hours a day. Roßkopf's regional counterpart Lars Wendland made similar comments. The fixed controls would not have a significant effect on reducing irregular migration, said the GdP chairman for federal police and customs in Berlin and Brandenburg. At least 90 to 95 percent of the migrants who cross the border apply for asylum. This means you cannot be turned away. “So what everyone is hoping for will not happen,” said Wendland. Controls on the German-Polish border have been increased; the police are currently recording refugees primarily in southern Brandenburg. She tries to get to the people behind the smuggling. In this context, Jens Schobranski explained that border controls make it easier to turn people back. When it comes to controls near the border, the federal police refer to them as “fictitious non-entry,” so that those checked are not yet considered to have entered the country. However, this practice does not apply to those seeking protection. Schobranski also confirmed that the right to asylum still applies to them. It therefore remains to be seen “to what extent this will change the entry numbers,” said the federal police spokesman. The freight transport industry is also critical of the new fixed controls on the border with Poland. The border has “a high volume of traffic both from commercial transport and commuter traffic,” said a spokeswoman for the Federal Association of Road Haulage, Logistics and Disposal (BGL) on Tuesday. From the border with Austria, where Germany has been carrying out permanent stationary border controls since 2015, it is known that these controls could lead to slow traffic and also traffic jams and accidents on the motorways. Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) announced on Monday after a long period of hesitation. In the future, the federal police will be able to use the entire package of stationary and mobile border police measures ""flexibly, depending on the current situation,"" she explained on Monday. The fixed checks by the federal police are initially scheduled to last ten days. Contribution by G.S.

As far as I know, the countries from which refugees come to the German borders are not on the Mediterranean either. Ms Meloni has asked the EU for help. Ms von der Leyen was in Lampedusa. Nothing has happened. Do you think the residents of Italy's islands like the situation? Protecting the EU's external borders is not just Italy's job and accusing Meloni of right-wing populist nonsense is just the usual Nazi club. Italy voted democratically and Meloni has 53% approval. It has to comply with EU regulations and, despite all the prophecies of doom, it has been doing so for 13 months. It would be nice if the EU took care of protecting the coasts of the Mediterranean instead of just making countries like Cyprus, Malta, Italy or Greece responsible and drinking coffee in Brussels. "" Treatments that would deter refugees, ""hence accepting migration as no alternative?"" Consequences ? "" because every place in Europe is still better than the places where they come from. "" That may well be true Matze: ""If we don't change the asylum law as soon as possible and change the material incentive to go to Germany at all costs, we will continue to receive hundreds of asylum seekers every day. Politicians know this, but they don't change anything."" That wouldn't change ANYTHING! Because the refugees are coming one way or another. You would just push them from one country to another, but not keep them out of Europe, because every place in Europe is still better than the places where they come from. This is all just a competition to see which country treats the refugees the most shabbily and thus pushes them into neighboring countries, which in turn also try to treat them even more shabbily and thereby push them back again. But such measures (“material incentives”) do not reduce the number of refugees in Europe at all. Treatments that would deter refugees from coming to Europe from the much worse misery in their homeland would violate human rights! As I understand it, all of these measures are ultimately about reducing unregulated immigration to Germany. to prevent. But, quote (GDP): ""At least 90 to 95 percent of the migrants who cross the border apply for asylum. You couldn't be turned away with that."" My question in this context? Why is there no immediate repatriation to the safe EU country of Poland or is only the BAMF and not the Federal Police authorized to do this? So the controls really only represent an annoying, resource-consuming obstacle to traffic, i.e. activism."" Many municipalities see themselves at the limit when it comes to the accommodation, care and integration of refugees."" (ARD) the traffic lights apparently don't care about closing national borders. I don't see any other option. And Germany must finally eliminate the various pull factors. I can understand that the Czech Republic and Poland don't want to act as bouncers for Germany. The traffic light government is solely to blame for the frightening migration to Germany. then you can leave it alone. These senseless and personnel-intensive actions only have one reason. Opium for the people. ""There have been no backlogs at the border so far, said federal police spokesman Jens Schobranski to rbb."" Yes, that's right. Yesterday the backlog only reached the intersection 1 Maja/aleja Niepodleglosci, i.e. just 2km. If border controls were to be carried out ""like in the 90s"" (and of course until 2008) (and thus break the Schengen Treaty) it would have almost no impact, because no one who applies for asylum would still be allowed to be sent back. unless he has already been deported once and is banned from entering the country. If we don't change the asylum law as soon as possible and change the material incentive to go to Germany, we will continue to receive hundreds of asylum seekers every day. Politics knows this, but doesn't change anything. The Czech Republic and Poland do not appear to have a “robust mandate” either. How else do refugees get to our border? Right-wing populist chatter doesn't help at all, see Meloni in Italy. If the police filter out such a transport, is there any way to take the driver into custody and take legal action against him? That's ultimately what it's all about, taking those who benefit from it out of circulation. With a kind of leniency program for the little slob behind the wheel, you could also get to the people behind it. Then that at least makes some sense. So far, the police have often only picked up migrants who are wandering around in fields and through forests. The smugglers will be back home long ago. These aren't border controls, are they? This is just to keep the voters quiet. There will be no change in the number of illegal entries. To do this you would have to monitor the border like in the 90s and everyone! check. The only decisive factor is whether fewer migrants come and are sent to the initial reception. I don't have the overview right now, but there are a lot of people on the internet who dismiss it as business fraud. Let's see what the reaction is. At the moment AfD is also at its highest level at Insa - traffic lights continue to shrink. With only 35.5 percent for all three parties, the traffic light coalition is far from a parliamentary majority. When asked whether Nancy Faeser (SPD) should resign as Federal Minister of the Interior after her election defeat in Hesse, 46 percent of those surveyed answered yes, 40 percent said no and 14 percent were undecided. To use? O As long as there is no robust mandate for rejection. Typical Faeser fog candle. As with everything the government “does” on this issue. This is how we get through until the next federal election."

Random border checks will start at 7:00 on Thursday. Austria, Poland and Czechia reintroduced border checks with Slovakia today. Acting Slovak PM Ľudovít Ódor said the measure will not solve the issue of illegal migration. “In the end, illegal migrants will not disappear. Therefore, we prefer a European solution,” he said on Wednesday, adding that border checks waste people’s time and put a strain on the state budget. He plans to table the topic at an informal meeting of EU leaders in Spain on October 6. “If we don’t want to say goodbye to the Schengen Area, the EU had better deal with illegal migration,” said the prime minister, comparing illegal migration to a “hot potato” that no country wants to deal with. Ódor said there would be no problem with borders if Poland, which will hold parliamentary elections next Sunday, had not announced checks on its border with Slovakia yesterday. Migration is a major topic in the Polish election campaign. Slovakia shares a 655-kilometre border with Hungary, including 35 border crossings. Currently, there are no plans for checks at green borders between both countries, which is partly formed by rivers. “We cannot close the border hermetically,” said Ódor. “Only the weather will probably stop illegal migrants.” Western Slovakia saw an influx of illegal migrants last autumn , and a few weeks ago, there were similar problems in southern and northern Slovakia. Illegal migrants see Slovakia as the first safe country they can arrive in. Slovak police are obliged to register every detained illegal migrant and the confirmation document they receive allows them to move around Slovakia. However, many illegal migrants wrongly believe that the document allows them to travel to other Schengen Area countries, including Germany. If the police, say, in Poland or Czechia detain illegal migrants with this paper, they are returned to Slovakia. But illegal migrants do not want to stay in Slovakia and the country cannot return illegal migrants to Hungary as Hungary is not honouring a migrant readmission agreement with Slovakia. In its latest decree, the Slovak government notes that the accumulation of illegal migrants in Slovakia following the introduction of internal border checks by its neighbours may affect Slovakia's security. From the beginning of 2023 to October 1, 2023, Slovakia registered 39,688 illegal migrants, which is an eleven-fold increase compared to the same period last year. Between Thursday and October 14, several hundred police officers and soldiers will carry out check suspicious vehicles at each of 35 border crossings with Hungary. The 10-day operation will cost €1.4 million."

Tank and cannon snow slopes have already opened in several different locations in central and northern Finland. Lapland also has plenty of natural snow in places. However, ski sellers are still waiting for natural snow all over the country, says the CEO of the Association of Fashion and Sports Retailers. - In previous years, equipment was purchased well in advance. Now the sale of ski equipment only starts with the first snowfalls and frosts. If it snows tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow we'll be at the ski shops, he states. the past couple of winters have been exceptionally good for ski retailers and sales volumes have more than doubled from before. In the 2021–2022 ski season, almost 160,000 pairs of skis were sold in Finland. At that time, there was enough snow from Hanko to Ivalo. In addition, the corona pandemic also inspired those whose last skiing trip had been for decades. It is believed that the new skini and nano skis will continue to keep this crowd as skiing lovers. Now, however, order and sales volumes are returning to a normal pace - and at the same time also at the mercy of the weather. - If there is no snow, the trade is weak. The last time southern Finland had a winter with little snow was in the 2019–2020 season, Kankaanpää recalls. The online store has been a tough challenger for brick-and-mortar retailers in the sale of many sports equipment. The ski shop is still largely traditional. - The customer wants the skis to be suitable for him and properly sized, says Kankaanpää. KSF Sport's ski factory in Kitee in North Karelia is also in a positive mood. More than 20,000 pairs of Bear and Yoko skis will leave the factory for the domestic market this year. - Pre-order volumes are close to last fall's level. There shouldn't be a shortage of goods, as some of the merchants have unsold last year's stock as well. Last winter, deliveries were delayed by strong demand across Europe, says the CEO. The ski shop starts properly only with the snowfall and winter. The most important period for manufacturers is January-February and the weeks before the ski holidays. - Then replenishment deliveries go to the stores. At the same time, it becomes clear what the winter will be like in the end and how much the general economic cycles affect, Kirvesniemi states. half of the production of the Kitee factories are skin skis, which have rapidly grown in popularity, the rest are nano and skating skis. An experienced professional in the skiing industry believes that the development leaps made in equipment in recent years will also bring more support to the number of enthusiasts. - In the same direction, cheap imports from Russia, which have stopped due to the war in Ukraine, also have an effect. Most of the cheap skis sold in supermarkets came from a factory near Moscow. Now they have been replaced by higher quality alternatives manufactured in Finland or Europe, says Kirvesniemi. Kitee's factories are busy anyway, because KSF Sport signed a three million euro supply contract for hunting with the Finnish Defense Forces and NATO's Logistics and Procurement Agency last spring. In the future, the same skis will also be produced for the civilian market. The Peltonen Skin ski factory operating in Heinola near Lahti has received a good number of pre-orders. As usual, the pace is expected to improve only with decent snowfalls. - The sales target for this season is a total of 60,000 pairs of skis, of which about a third will be exported. Our number one product is skins, says the CEO. He thinks that the record numbers of the previous two winters will still remain a dream. Of course, active enthusiasts renew their equipment regardless of the seasons and weather, but for those who ski less, purchases are easily moved forward due to the tightening economic situation. However, the fact that the popularity of skiing is now on a much more stable footing than it was 15 years ago brings faith in the future. At that time, many people lost their initial enthusiasm for skis that slip. - The situation is much brighter than the tip of the ski manufacturer. Outdoor exercise is increasing in popularity, and especially in the capital region, skiing is now on the rise, Akkanen states. The first track ruts were opened this fall in Levi. There, a four-kilometer run made of last winter's preserved snow opened for the most enthusiastic skiers on Friday, October 6. At the same time, the first ski slope was also opened."

From June 30 to July 9, public media will broadcast the proceedings of the XXVII General Latvian Song and XVII Dance Festival. All content about the Song and Dance Festival will converge on the public media portal LSM, where live broadcasts of the Song and Dance Festival will be shown. The portal offers a calendar of holiday programs and a wide range of original content. Summer festivals in Latvia gather a few tens of thousands of people, but in the world music concerts are attended by millions. It is thought that more than one person has questions - what is left after the fantastic emotions and the big party experienced by thousands of visitors? It's probably not just about waste. Rozītis admitted that during the Song Festival week, when several tens of thousands of people gather in Riga, it is necessary to think about how to continue traditions with as little impact on the environment as possible and to understand that this impact is there. ""I assume that in 10-15 years a festival of this level like this week will be very strongly accounted for by these influences. At the moment it is done voluntarily, sometimes with a light joke, as a kind of social responsibility, but I think this will be the last holiday. The World Wide Fund for Nature is an advisor to this celebration, and we have tried what we can with the understanding of the moment, with the budget possibilities of the moment, with the goodwill that can be changed; such everyday things that we put together. I think that in five, 10, 15 years it will already be a fundamental change with specific records,"" Rozītis assessed. After all, Riga has set the goal of moving towards climate neutrality. If the impact of major holidays on the environment is not accounted for and evaluated, the progress towards a capital city that would be climate neutral will be difficult. This time, they are only recommendations for organizers and business partners in creating the holiday. Next, it is planned to evaluate the impact of this Song Festival on the environment, and to make recommendations for changes to reduce it. ""This will be the first time that the impact of the Song and Dance Festival will be measured. It is more about how we will move forward, how we will look in the future,"" explained Rozītis. Jānis Brizga, doctor of environmental science, head of the ""Green Freedom"" society, explained that the impact of large events on the environment can be manifested in different ways - it's not just about waste. Waste is actually only a small part of the impact created. ""One of the things that this type of event has the biggest impact on the environment and climate is the movement of participants and guests, how they get to the venue. It may seem obvious to many people that we drive and we have to get there, but there are different ways to do it. We have already talked a lot about this,"" Brizga admitted. This mainly means that you should not go to large-scale events with your car, but use public transport, bike or walk. ""The biggest influence in such classical music festivals fluctuates a bit, but is between 65 and 80% - it's transport. Eight to 12% is energy consumption. It varies a little in each [study], but it's about five, seven percent - waste,"" Rozītis said. If we think about how to make the holiday more climate-friendly, maybe even climate-neutral in time, there must be clear guidelines already before the holiday and they must be communicated to the public, participants, and visitors in time so that the conditions can be clearly understood, Rozītis assessed. ""In any case, it is very serious what to do if we want to call [Song Festival] a climate-neutral festival. I would like to say that right now in Latvia we are moving towards it, but there are various artists in the world who have already announced that they will reduce their impact on the environment. ""Coldplay"" is the most visible band of all time, which has announced that it will continuously reduce its influence on concert tours. Various festivals have also announced this. Latvia - to be honest, we are neither with the Song and Dance Festival nor with any of the festivals even in the first hundred - there are events in the world with two, three million visitors, there are events in Europe with many hundreds of thousands of visitors, and its effects are very fundamental,"" concluded Rozītis. Science says that these festivals can be perceived as artificial cities, that they are like laboratories, where possible scenarios of how climate neutrality could proceed in the future can be played out, he added. The ""Lampa"" festival, although relatively small, is a pioneer in this regard, according to the producer of this festival, Lelde Pruse. ""Lampa"" has been thinking about these issues since the first year of its existence. I would like to divide sustainability issues into several parts, because one thing is what the visitor experiences, and the other thing is how the festival itself is organized, built, how we think about creating the festival so that it consumes as few resources as possible. ""Lampa"" is to some extent a pioneer of sustainability issues. From the point of view of the structure of the festival, we have been using and have created such a ""Lampa"" scenography system for quite a few years, using the same materials, stages, design, which changes or is modified a little every year. Just like ""Lego"" blocks - they create a new ""Lamp"" every year, but the blocks remain the same,"" Pruse shared her experience. CONTEXT: The XXVII General Latvian Song and XVII Dance Festival will resound in Riga from June 30 to July 9, 2023. The festival is organized by the Latvian National Cultural Center, which is a state institution subordinate to the Ministry of Culture.

The names of the hosts were confirmed by the president of the European umbrella football organization, Aleksander Čeferin, at a short ceremony held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon. The matches at Euro 2028 should be played in ten stadiums, six of which are in England, and one each in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Of the six English stadiums, two are in London, Wembley and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and the list also includes St. James' Park in Newcastle, Etihad (City Stadium) in Manchester, Villa Park in Birmingham and Everton's newly built stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock in Liverpool. The remaining four stadiums are Casement Park in Belfast, Aviva or Dublin Arena, Hampden Park in Glasgow and the Principality or National Stadium in Cardiff. None of the five host national teams is guaranteed a place in the final tournament. All will take part in the qualifiers, and Uefa will leave two reserved spots in case one of the five national teams fails to qualify for the final tournament. The English Football Association announced even before that announcement that their national team would participate in the qualifiers, so that the team would remain competitive. Great Britain and Ireland were due to compete to host the 2030 World Cup, but have shifted their bid to Euro 2028 after the tournament was expanded to 48 teams. The hosting of the WC 2030 was awarded to Morocco, Spain and Portugal by a controversial decision of the International Football Federation (FIFA), with the fact that three matches will be played on South American soil, so the tournament will be spread over as many as three continents. Italy and Turkey have not yet revealed the names of the cities where the Euro 2032 matches will be played, but it is certain that certain national teams will have to cover a large number of kilometers in that competition, considering that the capitals of these countries are separated by 1,400 km as the crow flies. ."

The number of corona infections is on the rise in Finland, according to recorded cases and wastewater studies. The corona situation is still calm, says Erika Lindh, a specialist researcher at the Institute of Health and Welfare (THL). However, according to Lindh, it is difficult to predict the epidemic situation in autumn and winter.","The number of corona infections is on the rise in Finland, according to recorded cases and wastewater studies. The corona situation is still calm, says Erika Lindh, a specialist researcher at the Institute of Health and Welfare (THL). However, according to Lindh, it is difficult to predict the epidemic situation in autumn and winter. - The Sars-cov-2 corona virus does not yet have a clear seasonal nature, but its circulation in the population continues with the transformation of the virus. The coronavirus can cause serious disease in sensitive population groups, just like influenza, Lindh reminds. - In addition, it should be noted that we still have population groups, such as the elderly, who have never encountered the virus, unlike other respiratory viruses that circulate in the population for a longer time. Vaccines are recommended The new omicron variants EG.5 and BA.2.86 of the coronavirus spreading around the world have attracted attention. EG.5 became the most common coronavirus variant in Finland in August. Its disease profile does not differ from other variants currently circulating, but its mutations may enhance its ability to evade immunity, says Lindh. THL therefore recommends booster vaccines for the elderly and risk groups. The other groups are still well protected, says chief physician Hanna Nohynek. - The majority of the population has encountered the virus and received several vaccine doses. When you look at their antibody response, children and working-age adults are well protected from serious disease. To some extent, newer virus variants evade the protection of antibodies, but there is no indication in the studies that they evade so much that there is no reason to think that the protection of a serious disease would be maintained. Even if a healthy child or adult of working age becomes infected, it does not mean that it will lead to a serious disease. - On the other hand, older people, people over the age of 18 who belong to medical risk groups and people over the age of 12 who are severely immunocompromised have been considered to be at such a risk that the achieved protection is not enough to fight a serious disease. Effective against new mutations The booster vaccine given is Biontech-Pfizer's Comirnatya. The new vaccines have been developed to respond to the 1.5 variant of the XBB subline, but based on antibody studies, they provide sufficient protection against the current EG.5 variant and also against BA.2.86, says Nohynek. The BA.2.86 variant has so far been detected very little - none at all in Finland. There is still little information about it, but the world health organization WHO is following it closely, because there is an exceptionally large number of mutations in its surface structures. Therefore, it can be assumed that the conversion will also differ from other conversions in its properties, says Lindh. Mask recommendation still exists THL's general mask recommendation was removed in April 2022. According to Nohynek, no similar, stronger recommendation is known to Finland so far. However, masks have not been completely removed from the selection of means at any point. - After all, we already have such a mask recommendation that if a person is symptomatic, they can wear a mask if they wish to protect others. - Even people who are prone to a serious disease can use a mask to avoid viral infections, not only from corona, but also from influenza, for example. Canada's highest health official, Theresa Tam, also said this week while wearing a mask at a press conference that masks should be used when the situation requires it."

[Continue reading on the site.]","Put Giovanni Galli one day at Cit Turin, home of goalkeepers for once. The former number one of the national team, Fiorentina, Napoli, Milan and Toro provided his invaluable advice to the young extreme defenders who are training this week in Corso Ferrucci in Turin in the internship organized by Willy Vignati of the La Cruz school. Anecdotes and suggestions for those who will one day follow his path but also views and opinions on today's goalkeepers: «I always return to Turin willingly: I fondly remember my year in the Granata. In fact, I'm sorry that my experience at Toro lasted only one season. It's a shirt that stays with you and I don't forget Philadelphia: mine was the last Toro that trained in that stadium and seeing the propeller of the Superga plane's engine, those lockers in the changing rooms makes you feel part of the history of this sport. And it's not just rhetoric."" Turin has always been home to great goalkeepers: «And it continues to be so. Milinkovic Savic had a great championship, over the top compared to previous years. He has finally shown what he is worth also because it seemed to me that he had achieved greater tranquility with ownership. I've always liked Szczesny. He covers the goal very well and is incredible one-on-one. Maybe he still needs to improve a little in the high exits and show more courage. In any case, Juve has Perin who could play as a starter in most Serie A teams: when he was called upon he always did very well and it is proof that the top teams must now have two number ones in their squad."" Perin is also the example that the Italian school of goalkeepers is always at the top: «Today in the extreme defenders we look for the physical structure but it is the technique that makes the difference. Foreigners want to come to us because they know that with our trainers they improve. We take them and make them grow: think of the steps forward that Onana, Allison or Neto have made."" Vicario, on the other hand, took the opposite path: «I think it is a defeat for our movement. The Italians must remain in Italy, they must be the reference for the goalkeepers of the future. It's true that football is now global, but who sees Donnarumma in France? The healthy spirit of emulation is lost."" The one who almost thirty years ago allowed Buffon to start his career in the Parma Primavera and to defend the posts of the ducals was Galli himself: «It seems that Gigi at 45 wants to go from goal to retirement. If this were the case, our sport would lose a lot: Buffon is an institution, in my opinion the strongest goalkeeper in Italian football also because he has lived through eras in which regulations and technique have changed and he has always adapted very well."" However, the legacy he leaves is in good hands: «In terms of personality, I like Maignan but for me the strongest is still Courtois, decisive in decisive moments. Real Madrid's last Champions League is largely thanks to him. On the other hand, I have always maintained it: the goalkeeper is just as important as a striker who scores 20 goals a season."""

Women's football has been on the rise worldwide for some time now, more and more nations are professionalizing women's football, the media are also taking greater interest - and many fans are happy about more visibility. While the importance of the sport is similar across countries in men's football, there are major differences in women's football, particularly due to cultural influences. We examine the question of how women's football differs from men's football, especially in terms of fan culture in different countries. We noticed that it is relatively difficult to get fans to take part around the games because they have other interests before and after than filling out a questionnaire. That's why we primarily address fans near fan festivals or sports bars, but also in the city, on the train, at the airport - exactly where you can talk to them. The more people participate, the better. At the moment we have 150 participants, but the World Cup is still running. The questions and statements we formulated are the first results of a preliminary study in which we have already surveyed fans from Germany and Australia. We now want to validate this with a larger sample. Some impressions are difficult to substantiate scientifically; for example, one would have to measure exactly how long men and women stay lying down after foul play. And. You see families with children, young and older people, women and men in the stadiums. You get the feeling that it's a very colorful mix and that everyone has the same goal of supporting their players. They want to have a good time together. And what's special is that the players like to get in touch with the fans and deal openly with many topics. . This is one of many topics. The fan culture in women's football is considered to be very inclusive, among other things, because everyone is welcome, regardless of gender and sexual orientation. This is usually not the case in men's football, where homosexuality, for example, is often still a taboo topic among players and fans. In women's football, most footballers are open about their sexuality. Fans who identify with the LGBTQ+ community appreciate having a sport where they feel accepted regardless of sexual orientation or gender. This term was used by many respondents in our preliminary study. Toxic masculinity here means very dominant, aggressive and even violent behavior, which is perceived as typically “masculine”, but can of course also be acted out by women. The behavior of the Colombian fans must be differentiated from this. This is normal in their fan culture and a sign of good entertainment and in no way to be equated with aggressiveness. Whistles and boos are often just part of the entertainment in South America. At first I was a bit disappointed that there was relatively little atmosphere outside the stadiums and fan miles. This is also because only the games of the Matildas, the Australian footballers, are shown on free-to-air television. The other games can only be seen on a paid streaming service and that is probably why many Australians initially noticed little about the World Cup. Nope. The national sports are different, but the lack of visibility is a cardinal problem for me. What is not shown is not present in consciousness. Let's just imagine if ARD and ZDF hadn't broadcast the World Cup in Germany. Then the interest would certainly have been significantly less. Now the Australians have achieved a lot by reaching the quarter-finals: Sam Kerr is a superstar on this continent. You notice that many girls admire her and want to emulate her. Such identification figures are very important. Girls in particular need role models like this in football to break old stereotypes. In this respect, the Matildas have achieved a lot. Of course, this has a lot to do with the cultural importance of sport and especially football. From my point of view, football is still viewed by many in Germany as a men's sport, while Australia speaks more of the “beautiful game”. Here football has almost a feminine connotation. In Australia, women's football is more popular than men's football. In the USA, women are also significantly more successful than men in football. In Arab countries it was and still is sometimes difficult for girls to want to play football. So there are discrepancies in access to the sport. We are actually talking about a data gap in this regard. Science is also primarily interested in men's sports. But that is changing. Interest in women's sports is increasing both in society and in science. In the course of many debates - take the keywords equal pay, equal opportunities and equal rights - it is now recognized that sport can provide impetus for changes in society. That's why we need research on women's sports, their fans and fan culture. I don't believe there will be a negative effect on German women's football despite the unexpectedly early elimination. Fans stick by their players and clubs even in crises. But I assume that the potential that existed through the World Cup, for example to promote women's football and inspire people in Germany, could not be used. There were only a few German fans in the fan zone in Sydney, but there was disbelief and disappointment, but - and this is reflected both in the conversations and in the discussions on social media - the need for analysis and explanations prevails. Working through possible shortcomings will hopefully help get the national team back on the road to success. That's what everyone wants. The best question at the end. As world champions, I have Japan and England as favorites."

Photo: ZDF/Svea Pietschmann","Heating law, basic child support, inflation, recession: the Chancellor is just seeing realities flying around his eye patch. Now Scholz is even courting the opposition, which he previously insulted with delight. Maybrit Illner also gives up: “Traffic lights in the crisis – no plan, no money, no trust?” The guests Christian Lindner (44, FDP). The finance minister praises his budget: “The one guardrail is: the debt brake applies. And the other guardrail is that we want to forego tax increases!” Ricarda Lang (29, Greens) . The party leader still wants to somehow get more state money from the federal treasurer for her green projects. Carsten Linnemann (46, CDU) . The Secretary General scoffs: “The only thing that has been achieved is working on a law regarding the legalization of drugs!” Verena Bentele (41, SPD). The VdK President warns: “A strong welfare state is also a basic requirement for a strong economy.” Eva Quadbeck (53) . The journalist (RND) complains: “The debt brake is a charade!” Government against opposition, theory against practice: The Zoff-O-Meter is expecting serious hits today! The talk group: Carsten Linnemann, Ricarda Lang, Maybrit Illner, Christian Lindner, Eva Quadbeck and Verena Bentele Photo: ZDF/Svea Pietschmann Most cinematic overture The talk show host chooses linguistic images from the football field for her traffic light criticism: “Open and hidden fouls, shots at your own Goal. Why should the interaction in the coalition get better now that it's about money?” Then the federal eye patch directs people's thoughts to Hollywood. About Lindner and Habeck as the knife-stabbing ruffians from “… because they don’t know what they’re doing,” the ARD clip says: “Loud noise about the heating law! High Noon im Kindergarten! Nervous gasps at the industrial electricity price! The traffic light actually needs a new script!” Most urgent demands Lindner starts with a realistic situation report: “The problems are obvious,” he states and lists them in order of urgency: “Firstly: We have to get migration under control. Making it easier to deport those who enter the welfare state irregularly!"" Federal Finance Minister Christian Lindner Photo: ZDF/Svea Pietschmann The VdK President believes ""that a lot can be changed by not only seeing people's problems, but also better explained.” Because, says Bentele: “The main effect of the disputes is that they only fuel dissatisfaction. We should talk a lot more about the solutions!” Verena Bentele Photo: ZDF/Svea Pietschmann Most expected relief offensive The Green Party leader introduces herself with a particularly clumsy propaganda slogan: It's not about green, yellow or red successes, she trumpets, but about the shared success: “Not your own party, but the country!” Then she goes on the attack: “I have often experienced in the last few weeks, especially from your party,” she answers Linnemann, “that the country has been talked about a bit badly , as the sick man of Europe!” The group was well-known, including: with Ricarda Lang Photo: ZDF/Svea Pietschmann Sharpest Scholz scolding “The Chancellor is negating the current situation!” Linnemann rages. “It’s so hard for me to say this. I have the feeling that he sits in the Chancellery and doesn't talk to the citizens, to the medium-sized companies!"" The CDU general judges Scholz's attempts to silence the opposition with a ""Germany Pact"": ""Actually, this is a vote of no confidence in him the traffic lights, towards your own people. It's a cry for help!"" Most detailed offer ""The Chancellor is calling on us to take part. We have proven that when it matters, we are there, Ukraine and the Bundeswehr,” states Linnemann. “But of course he has to see the situation. Example of migration: We have 80 percent more asylum applications than last year, and the year is not over yet!” Read also Ampel wants the change turbo, but... : The federal government has installed so few heat pumps Ampel wants to speed up heat pumps do it - but there's a problem with your own properties. Book reveals explosive Ukraine details: Musk's war power became scary Elon Musk first became a hero through Starlink. But then he thwarted attacks. “Scholz held a big refugee summit on the 10th. May. Made a holy promise. Nothing happens,” the CDU general continued to criticize. “We could immediately carry out border controls, safe countries of origin, benefits in kind. We could act immediately. But the Chancellor has to want it!” Most significant reactions “We are the sick man of Europe,” Linnemann then confirms to the Green Party leader’s rigid face. “A master butcher in my region told me: The best decision was to close my shop, and I'm glad that my children are doing something else!” Lindner remains true to the traffic light trick: it's always someone else's fault. The minister complains that the “CDU-led states of Schleswig-Holstein and Berlin” did not agree to his growth law. When it comes to migration policy, he could “agree with a lot of what Linnemann said.” The FDP leader argued on the traffic light line Photo: ZDF/Svea Pietschmann Own goal! Because the CDU general promptly nails him: “Then why don’t we do it?” Lindner quickly raises his hand and holds up the tried-and-tested lightning rod of the traffic light: “I believe that we now have a completely different migration policy in the EU than in the Merkel era.” Gosh! Most interesting information The Green Party leader would like to score points with a tirade about Bavarian beer tent speeches in Gillamoos: That's not responsible opposition work, she blasphemes. Motto: Bayern bashing always works! But not this time, she immediately countered Linnemann: “Friedrich Merz was in the Chancellery today,” he reported to the surprised group. “Took on responsibility. He sought a conversation with the Chancellor to set an example.” Bang! Most annoying interjection Illner immediately pricks up her ears: “Uh!” she is taken aback. But Lang didn't hear the shot and continues to lecture undeterred about the differences between Kreuzberg and Gillamoos. Uff! The talk show host would much rather know: “What came out of this conversation?” But the party leader is already launching the next long-winded attack against the Union. Aww! Most unfair question It was only after two minutes that Illner managed to stop the flow of green speech: “Sorry! What did the gentlemen exchange?” she asks the CDU general. “You talked about the current situation,” answers Linnemann. About the big challenges such as mass migration ..."" Illner wanted to know from Linnemann what was happening in the Chancellery Photo: ZDF/Svea Pietschmann He doesn't get any further because Lindner smells the roast and immediately wipes it off with old broth: ""Where were these positions in the years 2015 and following,” the minister sneers, alluding to Merkel’s “We can do it.” However, the “Zeit” analyzed in 2016: “The FDP is fishing in the areas between the Union and the AfD.” Horrido! Most pharmaceutical analysis “In the two years that it has been in power, the traffic light has not been able to show that it is capable of solving problems,” says journalist Quadbeck coolly. “The coalition agreement says ‘progress coalition’, and exactly this progress has not materialized noticeably.” Rumms! Added to this is “this destructive dispute that the traffic lights have waged for months, culminating again and again in the dispute over the energy law,” adds Quadbeck. “And then there was a chancellor who intervened from time to time, but very often Scholz took out a large tube of white ointment and said, everything is fine.” Hit, sunk! Coolest counterattack Lindner once again calls the old ghosts of guilt out of the grave: “Germany has withdrawn from nuclear energy and coal under the leadership of the Union,” he pipes up. And “a lot of the “rampant bureaucracy” comes from Brussels, also under the leadership of a CDU Commission President.” Groan! “But it doesn’t help us now to say that they’re to blame,” the minister adds demurely, but he can’t get away with that: “Then why do you do it all the time?” Linnemann mocks and also makes this point. Last stand Finally, the Green Party leader wants to sell basic child welfare as a shining example of reducing bureaucracy. Linnemann can't believe it: “It's estimated at 2.4 billion, and the experts say that 500 million is bureaucracy. That's crazy!” Citizens' money also goes to the CDU general: “I want,” he says, “that those who can work also have to work. This is what the people who work every day and who make the welfare state capable of with their tax money expect.” Amen! Quote of the evening “We don't have a bad economy, we have a bad government!” CDU General Carsten Linnemann Conclusion: Lots of know-it-all gibberish, self-praise sequences like from a speech machine, self-revealing phrases (“honestly speaking”) and even the talk show host got too carried away minute-long monologues: This was a talk show in the “Many words are the death of the truth” category."
